What is PL/SQL?
- Procedural Language for SQL is Oracle Corporationâ€™s extension for SQL, combining SQL with procedural programming features like loops, conditions, functions, and triggers.

Comparison between SQL and PL/SQL
- SQL executes a single query at a time whereas PL/SQL executes blocks of code at once which increases processing speed.
- PL/SQL provides support features like variables, if-else statements and loops. SQL does not support these features.
- PL/SQL also offers error and exception-handling features that do not exist in SQL.
- PL/SQL is used to write a programming block that has procedures, functions, triggers, packages and variables within its syntax. On the other hand SQL queries and commands are written using DDL and DML.

Basic structure of a PL/SQL block
  DECLARE
    -- variable declarations
  BEGIN
    -- executable statements
  EXCEPTION
    -- exception handling
  END;

Triggers
- Triggers are stored programs activated automatically before or after DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on a table
