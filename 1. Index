Difference between SQL and PL/SQL
- SQL is a non-procedural language that executes a single query at a time whereas PL/SQL is a procedural language and executes blocks of code at once which helps reduce traffic and increases processing speed.
- PL/SQL provides support features such as variables, if-else statements and loops such as for, while. SQL does not provide support for these features.
- PL/SQL also offers error and exception-handling features that do not exist in SQL.
- PL/SQL is used to write a programming block that has procedures, functions, triggers, packages and variables within its syntax. On the other hand SQL queries and commands are written using DDL and DML.


Structure of a PL/SQL block
---------------------------
DECLARE 
   <declarations section> 
BEGIN 
   <executable command>
EXCEPTION 
   <exception handling> 
END;
